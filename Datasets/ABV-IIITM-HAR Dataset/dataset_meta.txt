ABV-IIITM-HAR Dataset Description
=================================

Overview:
---------
This dataset contains smartphone sensor data collected from multiple participants performing various physical activities. Each top-level folder (e.g., 01, 02, ..., 11) represents data collected by a unique participant.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
- Each participant folder contains subfolders, each corresponding to a specific activity session.
- The first three letters of each subfolder indicate the activity:
    - cyc: Cycling
    - wlk: Walking
    - ups: Upstairs (ascending stairs)
    - dws: Downstairs (descending stairs)
    - idl: Idle (no movement)
    - jog: Running (jogging)

Data Collection:
----------------
- Data was recorded using the "Sensor Logger" app:
    - Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kelvin.sensorapp&hl=en_IN
    - App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensor-logger/id1531582925
- Each activity folder contains CSV files with sensor data:
    - Accelerometer.csv
    - Gyroscope.csv
    - (Optionally) AccelerometerUncalibrated.csv, GyroscopeUncalibrated.csv, and others.

CSV File Structure:
-------------------
Example: Accelerometer.csv and Gyroscope.csv

Column Name       | Description
------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
time              | Raw timestamp in nanoseconds (since epoch, as recorded by the device)
seconds_elapsed   | Time elapsed in seconds since the start of the recording
z                  | Sensor reading along the Z-axis (m/s² for accelerometer, rad/s for gyroscope)
y                  | Sensor reading along the Y-axis (m/s² for accelerometer, rad/s for gyroscope)
x                  | Sensor reading along the X-axis (m/s² for accelerometer, rad/s for gyroscope)

- Accelerometer.csv: Contains linear acceleration data along the three axes (x, y, z).
- Gyroscope.csv: Contains angular velocity data along the three axes (x, y, z).
- The axes are defined according to the smartphone's orientation as per Android/iOS standards.

Notes:
------
- Each row in the CSV files represents a single sensor reading at a specific timestamp.
- The seconds_elapsed column is useful for aligning data across different sensors or sessions.
- The data can be used for human activity recognition (HAR), time-series analysis, and machine learning applications.

Annotation.csv:
---------------
- In some folders, an Annotation.csv file may be present for manual or automatic labeling, but it may be empty or unused in this dataset.

Uncalibrated Sensor Files:
-------------------------
- Files like AccelerometerUncalibrated.csv and GyroscopeUncalibrated.csv (if present) contain raw sensor data before device calibration. Their columns are typically similar but may include additional bias or offset columns.

Data Coverage per Activity (in minutes):
----------------------------------------
- walk: 108.43
- idle: 72.90
- cycling: 64.18
- running: 32.94
- stairs_up: 28.82
- stairs_down: 24.82

Note on Data Imbalance:
-----------------------
The dataset is imbalanced, with more data for walking and idle activities. This reflects real-world behavior, as walking and being idle are more common in daily life compared to activities like running or climbing stairs.
